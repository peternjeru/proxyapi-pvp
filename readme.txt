Accept Safaricom Lipa na M-Pesa payments using Pay via ProxyAPI


== Description ==
The Pay via ProxyAPI (PVP in short) extension for WooCommerce enables you to accept payments for Safaricom's M-Pesa payment gateway via ProxyAPI.

PVP enables one to directly integrate into MPesa using both Lipa na M-Pesa and C2B APIs. It enables you to simplify your checkout process and allow a customer to simply enter their phone number and have the Lipa na MPesa payment prompt sent immediately to their phone numbers, and the responses and callbacks automatically processed by WooCommerce.

For any assistance in your setup, please join the Support group at [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/I-jBHE2JnVFAfGpjWRgJbA) or drop your query in the [Support Section](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-pay-via-proxyapi/). A response will be given asap.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What version of PHP is required for this plugin to work? =
Use PHP v5.6 or later.

= Can someone on Daraja API use this plugin? =
No, you need to be aboard ProxyAPI to be able to use this plugin.

= Does this plugin process M-Pesa callbacks? =
Yes, the plugin is set up to directly receive callbacks from both Daraja and ProxyAPI and process each separately for the same transaction

= Does this plugin have a separate M-Pesa transactions table? =
No, the plugin places the transaction details directly as metadata into the order. This enables for a simpler and more convenient way to view MPesa results. But in case you need to check all transactions or get a separate list of transactions, you have access to the [ProxyAPI portal](https://api.proxyapi.co.ke/) where you get a list of all Pay via ProxyAPI transactions sent through it and their current status (whether they were succesful or not).

= Does the plugin automatically complete transactions? =
Yes, depending on the result received from Daraja or ProxyAPI. If a transaction returned a failed error code, the equivalent order is marked as failed too. If the transaction was a success, the equivalent order will be assigned the MPesa Transaction ID as its own unique Transaction ID and marked as complete.
